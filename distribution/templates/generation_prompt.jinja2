You are an expert software developer. Generate a complete, production-ready {{ app_type }} application based on the following requirements:

## Application Requirements
**Type**: {{ app_type }}
**Description**: {{ description }}
**Technology Stack**: {{ tech_stack | join(', ') }}
**Deployment Target**: docker

{% if features %}
## Required Features
{% for feature in features %}
- {{ feature }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if requirements %}
## Additional Requirements
{% for req in requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Output Requirements

Provide a complete application with the following structure. Format your response as JSON with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "main.py": "# Main application file content here",
    "requirements.txt": "# Python dependencies here",
    "Dockerfile": "# Docker configuration here",
    "README.md": "# Documentation here",
    "static/style.css": "# CSS styles here",
    "templates/index.html": "# HTML template here"
  }
}
```

## Code Quality Standards
1. **Complete and Functional**: All code must be complete, working, and production-ready
2. **Best Practices**: Follow industry best practices for the chosen technology stack
3. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive comments and README
4. **Security**: Implement basic security measures (input validation, etc.)
5. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and logging
6. **Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration
7. **Testing**: Include basic test structure where appropriate

{% if 'python' in tech_stack %}
## Python-Specific Requirements
- Use FastAPI for web applications
- Include proper async/await patterns where beneficial
- Use Pydantic for data validation
- Include uvicorn server configuration
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
{% endif %}

{% if 'docker' in deployment_target %}
## Docker Requirements
- Multi-stage build if beneficial
- Proper port exposure
- Health check implementation
- Optimized layer caching
- Security best practices (non-root user)
{% endif %}

{% if 'dashboard' in app_type %}
## Dashboard-Specific Requirements
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Real-time data updates capability
- Clean, modern UI/UX
- Navigation and layout structure
{% endif %}

Generate a complete, working application that can be immediately built and deployed. Every file should contain complete, functional code - no placeholders or TODO comments.
